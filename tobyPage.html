            Positive Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Society
        </h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment. Here are some of the positive contributions of AI to society:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI has the potential to transform healthcare by improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools can help doctors identify diseases more accurately and quickly, leading to better outcomes for patients.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transportation:</strong> AI is being used to improve transportation systems, making them safer, more efficient, and more sustainable. For example, self-driving cars can reduce accidents and traffic congestion, while AI-powered traffic management systems can optimize traffic flow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Entertainment:</strong> AI is being used to create new forms of entertainment, such as virtual reality and augmented reality experiences. AI-powered algorithms can also personalize content recommendations, making it easier for people to discover new music, movies, and TV shows.
